That's why, working with our military leaders, I have proposed a new 
defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the 
world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget. To 
stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I have already sent this 
Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing 
danger of cyber-threats. 

Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform 
who defend it. As they come home, we must serve them as well as they 
served us. That includes giving them the care and benefits they have 
earned â€“ which is why we've increased annual VA spending every year 
I've been President. And it means enlisting our veterans in the work 
of rebuilding our Nation.
